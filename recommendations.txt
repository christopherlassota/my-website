Recommendations for completing the portfolio project

1. Fix content/typos and encoding
- Correct spelling in About and Experience ("Delievering", "buisness", "reasearch", "english").
- Replace garbled characters in `Hero.tsx` (â€” â€™) with proper apostrophes/em dashes.
- Remove duplicate Education card or replace with the correct second entry.

2. Make navigation functional
- Replace header and footer list items with `Link` components pointing to `"/"`, `"/about"`, and new routes (e.g., `"/projects"`, `"/contact"`).
- Update the “Let’s Talk”, “Get in Touch”, and “View My Work” buttons to use routes or external URLs.

3. Add missing pages/sections
- Create `Projects` page with a grid of project cards fed by a data file (JSON/TS array) to avoid repetition.
- Create `Contact` page with a simple form (name, email, message) and mailto or form handler.
- Consider a `Resume` link or downloadable PDF in `public/`.

4. Standardize assets
- In SCSS, use `url("/images/...")` for public assets to avoid path issues in Vite.
- Add `alt` text for images and use `<img>` where possible for accessibility and SEO.

5. Improve responsiveness and layout
- Adjust `.hero__picture` sizing; `width: 5%` at tablet looks too small.
- Ensure cards stack and spacing stays consistent on mobile.
- Add `max-width` and center constraints for readable line length.

6. Accessibility and semantics
- Replace `div`/`li` click targets with real links/buttons.
- Use heading levels in order and avoid skipping levels.
- Add focus states and sufficient color contrast.

7. Content polish for hiring
- Add 3–6 real projects with short problem/solution bullets and tech tags.
- Add metrics (performance gains, users served, process improvements) where possible.
- Include a brief skills section and tooling (React, TypeScript, Node, SQL, testing).

8. Code cleanup
- Extract repeated card markup into reusable components (`ProjectCard`, `ExperienceItem`, `EducationItem`).
- Move static data into `src/data/` so content edits don’t touch JSX.
- Add ESLint/prettier scripts if not already configured.

Suggested near-term sequence
1) Fix typos/encoding and image paths.
2) Add Projects + Contact routes and update navigation.
3) Build data-driven sections and polish content.
4) Improve layout, accessibility, and final styling.
