Recommendations for completing the portfolio project

Completed
- Fixed content/typos and character encoding in hero/about/experience.
- Navigation is functional with routes for Home, About, Projects, Contact.
- Added Projects and Contact pages.
- Standardized public asset paths using `/images/...` where needed.
- Improved responsiveness: hero image sizing, responsive grids, max-width container.
- Added focus-visible styles and improved link semantics.
- Moved project/experience/education data into `src/data/` and reused `ProjectCard`.
- Added a Skills section.

Remaining (High Impact)
1. Resume link
- Add `public/resume.pdf` (or preferred filename) and wire a Resume link in header/footer/contact.

2. External links for remaining socials
- Replace placeholder Instagram/YouTube links or remove icons if not used.

3. Project detail polish
- Add live/demo and GitHub links per project.
- Add 1–2 bullet outcomes/metrics per project (performance, users, impact).

4. Accessibility upgrades
- Replace CSS background images with `<img>` where practical to enable `alt` text.
- Ensure headings are strictly hierarchical across pages.

5. Contact form behavior
- Decide on `mailto:` submit or a form handler (Netlify/Formspark/etc.).

6. Component cleanup
- Optionally extract `ExperienceItem` and `EducationItem` components for consistency.

New Suggestions
- Add a short “Featured case study” section on Home with a single project deep dive.
- Add a “Services” or “What I can help with” section to clarify offerings.
- Add Open Graph meta tags in `index.html` for better link previews.
- Add a lightweight analytics snippet (optional) to track visits.
- Add a `README.md` with setup and deployment steps.

Suggested next sequence
1) Add resume PDF + wire links.
2) Add live/demo/GitHub links + project outcomes.
3) Choose contact form behavior and implement.
4) Improve image accessibility with `<img>` + `alt`.
5) Optional cleanup and extras (components, OG tags, README).
